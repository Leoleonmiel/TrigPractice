# Overview
This is a small **C++20** program that visualizes basic trigonometric relationships on a circle.  
It was written in under three hours as a simple exploration of vector math and geometry
# Purpose
- a vector constrained to the circle  
- the angle it forms with the horizontal axis  
- cosine and sine projections  
- a tangent line derived from the vector direction  = geometric tangent and not triogonemtric tangent
- determinants for signed orientation  
# Implementation
- **C++20**  
- SFML for rendering  
- custom math helpers (dot product, determinant, projection, normalization)

The structure is intentionally minimal to keep the focus on the trigonometric concepts.
